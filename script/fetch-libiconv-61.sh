# When compiling `superstring` on macOS, we used to be able to rely on the
# builtin version of `libiconv`. But newer versions of macOS include FreeBSD
# `libiconv`, rather than GNU `libiconv`; the two are not API-compatible.
#
# For this reason, we download a known good version of `libiconv` from
# https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/libiconv/tree/libiconv-61.
#
# We might eventually replace this approach with an explicit vendorization of
# the specific files needed, but that would require a universal build of
# `libiconv.2.dylib`. For now, letting the user compile their own `libiconv`
# has the advantage of very likely matching the system's architecture.
